      <h1>You're an amazing freind!</h1>
      <p>
        To tell the truth, i didn't think i would be able to make this on time, but i tried my best to give you a showage
        of appreciation. Even though we don't talk a lot you're still my  bestfreind and i just wanted to show you that it's not just your family who cares about you. I don't know a lot about you so i just put some images and a my favorite image at the bottom. I hope you have an amazing year and uhh I'll make something even better for you next year!

      <h1>One word, <span>fantastic</span></h1>
      <p>That's the word i would use to describe you. Even though i don't know a lot about you it makes me wonderous.
        Anways your childness is amazing, even though you don't text a lot but you text more then others.
        There isn't really anything you should change about you (except for your response times on messages) so keep
        being you the that's how you met most of us :).
